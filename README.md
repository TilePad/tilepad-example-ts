# Tilepad + TS Plugin

This template provides a minimal template for building a **TilePad** plugin using the TypeScript language.

## Getting started

For help with getting started check out [Getting Started](https://tilepad.pages.dev/plugins/getting-started/)

## Included in this template

- Basic TypeScript + rollup configuration
- Basic counter example project
  - Tile actions for increasing and decreasing a shared counter
  - Inspector UI for choosing the "amount" of increasing / decreasing per tile
- CI for building and bundling releases

## Creating a release

Create a new release tag:

```sh
git tag "0.1.0"
```

Push the release tag to github:

```sh
git push --tags
```

Your project will be built and bundled in CI on github, after this is complete you will find a draft
release under Releases containing the .tilepadPlugin file
